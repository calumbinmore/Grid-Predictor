# Grid-Predictor
My project where I aim to calculate the energy demand on the National Grid. The Demand faced by the Grid naturally varies throughout the day depending on the behaviour of the population, rising when people are using electrical appliances, when they are cooking dinner for example, and decreases in the early hours of the morning when the majority of people are asleep. Additionally, environmental factors such as the temperature affect the demand, and I may try ot take into account surges of activity such as large sporting events or holidays.
